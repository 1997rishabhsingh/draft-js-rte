# Rich Text Editor
___

This is a version of the rich text editor I created for use in [TazWorks'](https://tazworks.com) Instascreen web app. It is built on the [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org) framework for React. The [Github repo is here](https://github.com/EvanMorrison/draft-js-rte).

Notable features include:
- support for tables
- insert and resize images
- insert and edit links
